# phishstats-backend

A FastAPI backend scaffold for the phishstats web application.

## Stack
- FastAPI with async handlers
- SQLAlchemy async + asyncpg
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS
- Alembic migrations
- Docker and Docker Compose

## Project layout
- `app/` application code
- `alembic/` migrations
- `scripts/` helper scripts for seed/reset/backup/restore
- `docs/` supporting project documentation
- `tests/` test suite

## Running with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The backend container runs `alembic upgrade head` automatically before starting FastAPI.

API base URL:
- `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`

## Useful commands

Run tests locally:
```bash
pytest
```

Seed studio albums and songs:
```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/seed_db.py
```

Verify seeded albums:
```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/verify_seed.py
```

Reset albums and reseed:
```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/reset_db.py
```

Backup database:
```bash
./scripts/backup_db.sh backup.sql
```

Restore database:
```bash
./scripts/restore_db.sh backup.sql
```

## Seed data
- `scripts/albums_seed.py` contains the current Phish studio album list and release years.
- `scripts/songs_seed.py` contains the canonical studio album song catalogue plus ordered per-album track mappings used to assign `album_id` and `track_number`.
- `scripts/seed_db.py` inserts missing album rows first, then inserts missing song rows directly into `songs` with album linkage.

## Schema notes
- Songs now link directly to albums through `songs.album_id`.
- `songs.track_number` preserves album ordering.
- Migration `0002_remove_album_songs_table.py` removes the old `album_songs` join table and migrates existing relationship data onto `songs`.
- With the current schema, a song belongs to at most one album record.
